## Description

My movtivation to build a working calendar was to show the progression of my JavaScript skills.  Also to show my added JQuery skills. 
I built this project to test my JavaScript and JQuery skills and to continue to show my progression of coding. 
The calendar solved the problem of forgetting events or tasks.  As long as events are stored in the calender it will remind you of them.
I learned that API's are awesome, and that I have a long road ahead of learning all the features they add.

The calendar shows the current time and below has time slots for the work day, 9am - 5 pm. If the time is in the past the background will be grey, present is red and green is future. Click the time slot that you would like to store the event at, enter details of event, then click the save button to store info on the local storage.
